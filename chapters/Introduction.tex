\chapter{Introduction}

\paragraph{   } C is a low-level programming language designed for high portability and fast performance. C first originated in the late 1970's when Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie wrote the book, \textit{The C Programming Language}. C has tremendously influenced the world of programming, leading to the development of C++, an object oriented version of C, and the syntax of many other languages, like Java. C is still widely used today, in many applications such as databases, kernels, drivers, and much more. One of the most popular programming languages, Python, runs on an interpreter written in C.

\par This chapter will introduce the very fundamental ideas behind programming, and work as a primer for learning actual C concepts. Ideas such as addressing, memory, the stack, the heap, variables, printing, files will be discussed with friendly examples. If you have no or little experience in programming, it is highly recommended you start with this chapter. Otherwise, skip ahead to the next chapter.

\section{Programs and Computing}

\par In the most basic sense, a computer is a machine which can complete tasks by running instructions commonly known as "code". A computer cannot read or understand human languages, like English. A computer only understands instructions in a format known as \textit{binary} code. Binary code is composed entirely of one's and zeros. $00000001$ is an example of binary, which actually translates to the number, $1$. 
\paragraph{ A programming language} is a human readable language which is \textit{compiled} into binary code.

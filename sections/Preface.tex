\paragraph{   } This book is intended to serve as a tool to learn how to program in the C programming language. The book is targeted at those who have little to no experience in programming or computer science as a whole. Even if someone hasn't learned any prior programming languages, this book can serve as a first learning experience. This book discusses in depth the low level components of the C language, like memory, addresses, the stack, the heap, and more. The book introduces programming and C from the ground up, simplifying concepts often claimed as difficult or complex.

\par This books also introduces computer science concepts, like functions, types, data structures and algorithms, in the context of the C language. The purpose of this is to teach the fundamentals of programming from a simple, backbone starting point, and work up to more "magic" levels of abstraction, such as those seen in the Python language. This approach exposes students to a mechanical and complex understanding of programming. Such insight is exceptionally useful when optimizing and writing high performance software.

\par The book pays careful attention to the features of C which are often described as confusing, such as the \textit{void} pointer, the functions \textit{malloc} and \textit{free}, and much more.
